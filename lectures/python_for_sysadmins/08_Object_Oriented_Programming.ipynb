    "In Python, everything is an __`\"object\"`__. So when you create a variable, you actually created an object. The object you create is used to _store values_ (called __attribute__s) and _have special functions_ (called __method__s) which interacts with the object's values.\n",
    "You can even create your own objects, by defining a __`\"class\"`__.\n",
