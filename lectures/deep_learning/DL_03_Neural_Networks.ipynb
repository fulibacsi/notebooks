    "\n",
    "As we saw in the previous notebook, a single neuron is not able to solve non-linear problems. But they are not called **networks** for nothing! The power of artificial neural networks lies in their topology.  \n",
    "If we connect more of the **neurons** we get a (real) neural network (*ANN* or *NN*). The neurons are ordered into **layer**s.  \n",
    "The first layer is the **input layer** then there are zero, or more **hidden layer**(s), finally there is the **output layer**. Each layer can cosist any number of neurons. Based on the different topologies there are different ANN subtypes.  \n",
    "The most simple version of ANNs is the multi layer feed forward perceptron network (MLP). \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "The prediction is called a forward propagation as the information travels  through the network from the input layer to the output. Each neuron in the network processes its inputs individually by summing the weighted inputs and transforming it by an activation function. The outputs of neurons in a layer will be the inputs of the neurons on the next layer.\n",
    "In practice the bias term is included in the weights and a constant input is intorduced each layer to support this inclusion.\n",

    "\n",
    "The weight updating algorithm is called [**Backpropagation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation). It basically propagates the errors back to their \"root\" neuron. So every neuron which was (even slightly) responsible for an error will get their weights updated accordingly. The weight updating equations can be find by calculating the gradient similarly to the Perceptron rules. Backpropagation is similar to [gradient descent rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation#Derivation)."
