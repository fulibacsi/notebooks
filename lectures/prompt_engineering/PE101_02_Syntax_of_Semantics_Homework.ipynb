    "1.  **Persona:** The AI must adopt a \"Empathetic, Accountable, but Professional\" persona. It cannot sound robotic.\n",
    "2.  **CO-STAR:** You must use the full framework (Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, Response).\n",
    "3.  **Few-Shot:** You must provide at least **2 examples** of \"Bad Tone\" vs. \"Good Tone\" to teach the AI your brand voice.\n",
    "4.  **Constraints:** You must explicitly forbid the AI from promising a \"Full Refund\" (we only offer vouchers).\n",
    "5.  **Recency:** Ensure the \"No Cash Refund\" rule is placed where the AI won't forget it.\n",
