    "### 1. What Are LLMs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) are deep learning models trained on massive corpora of text data to understand, generate, and manipulate human language. They are built primarily using transformer architectures and are capable of performing a wide variety of language tasks with little to no task-specific training.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Core capabilities and popular examples\n",
    "\n",
    "- Text generation (e.g., writing, summarizing, translation)\n",
    "- Code generation and completion\n",
    "- Question answering and information retrieval\n",
    "- Reasoning, classification, and sentiment analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Popular LLMs:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- GPT-4 (OpenAI)\n",
    "- Claude (Anthropic)\n",

    "#### Prompting\n",
    "- Using a pre-trained LLM with no additional training.\n",
    "- You write prompts designed to elicit the behavior you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Few-shot learning\n",
    "- Including a few examples within the prompt to guide the model.\n",
    "- Often more reliable than zero-shot prompting on complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fine-tuning\n",
    "- Updating model weights using domain/task-specific data.\n",
    "- Requires infrastructure and training data but gives better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Training your own model\n",
    "- Training from scratch or starting from a small base model.\n",

    "\n",
    "Designing effective prompts is an essential skill when working with LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a prompt?\n",
    "\n",
    "A prompt is an input or query given to a large language model to elicit a specific response or output.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is prompt engineering?\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining prompts to optimize the quality, relevance, and consistency of responses generated by LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What does a good prompt look like?\n",
    "\n",
    "A well-structured prompt typically includes the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Instruction**: A clear directive that specifies what the model should do.\n",
    "- **Context**: Background information that helps the model understand the task.\n",
    "- **Input / Question**: The specific query or data to be processed.\n",
    "- **Output Type / Format**: The desired structure or format of the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Summarize* the following movie script and write a list of *top 3 most important points in markdown format* that answer the following *question*:  \n",
    "**\"What should the King of Britons know about?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Script:**  \n",
    "<The movie script of *Monty Python and the Holy Grail*>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `\"Summarize\"` is the **instruction**\n",
    "- The **script** is the **context**\n",
    "- The **question** is the **input / question**\n",
    "- `\"top 3 most important points in markdown format\"` is the **output format**\n",

    "### 4. Anatomy of an LLM Interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding how LLMs process and respond to inputs is key to designing effective prompts, debugging issues, and customizing outputs. This section breaks down the major components involved in a typical LLM interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input / Output Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, here’s what happens in an LLM call:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You send a **text input** (the prompt) to the model through an API or interface.\n",
    "2. The model:\n",
    "   - **Tokenizes** the text into smaller units (tokens).\n",
    "   - **Processes** the tokens through its neural network layers.\n",
    "   - **Generates** one or more output tokens based on the model’s prediction of what should come next.\n",
    "3. The output tokens are **decoded** back into human-readable text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output can be a:\n",
    "- **Plain string** (most common)\n",
    "- **Structured JSON** (if you format prompts carefully)\n",
    "- **Function call / tool usage request** (if supported by the model)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Role-Based Messages and Model Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Most modern LLM APIs, especially those inspired by OpenAI’s `chat` format, use **role-based prompting** to give context:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `system`: Sets the behavior or persona of the assistant. Think of it as instructions for how the model should “act.”\n",
    "- `user`: The person interacting with the assistant.\n",
    "- `assistant`: The model’s previous replies (can be included to maintain context).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "[\n",
    "  {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant who always answers with Monty Python references.\"},\n",
    "  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What's the capital of Assyria?\"}\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also tweak the model’s behavior with **generation parameters**:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Parameter         | Description                                                  |\n",
    "|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| `temperature`     | Controls randomness. Lower = more deterministic, higher = more creative |\n",
    "| `max_tokens`      | Limits how long the output can be                            |\n",
    "| `top_p`           | Controls sampling diversity (used in nucleus sampling)       |\n",
    "| `frequency_penalty` | Penalizes repetition of tokens                          |\n",
    "| `presence_penalty`  | Encourages inclusion of new topics                      |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tokenization and Decoding Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tokenization** is how raw text is broken down into subword units the model understands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common methods:\n",
    "- **BPE (Byte Pair Encoding)** – used by GPT-style models\n",
    "- **WordPiece / SentencePiece** – used in models like BERT or T5\n",
    "- Emoji, punctuation, and code can be split across multiple tokens!\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this matters:\n",
    "- Token count affects cost and performance.\n",
    "- Poorly structured prompts might waste tokens or confuse the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decoding strategies** affect how outputs are generated:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Strategy              | Description |\n",
    "|----------------------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Greedy**            | Always picks the highest-probability next token. Can be repetitive. |\n",
    "| **Top-k sampling**    | Samples from the top `k` most likely tokens. Adds variability. |\n",
    "| **Top-p (nucleus)**   | Samples from the smallest set of tokens whose combined probability exceeds `p`. More dynamic than top-k. |\n",
    "| **Beam search**       | Explores multiple output branches simultaneously. Good for tasks like translation. |\n",
    "\n",
    "Each strategy has trade-offs between creativity, determinism, and coherence.  \n",
    "Try different settings to explore how responses change!"

    "\n",
    "Effective prompt engineering requires clarity, structure, and awareness of the model’s behavior. Below are principles and strategies that help you craft more reliable and robust prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Clarity and Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "A well-structured prompt typically includes:\n",
    "- **Instruction**: What should the model do? (e.g., *Summarize*, *Translate*, *Classify*)\n",
    "- **Context**: Any relevant background information\n",
    "- **Input**: The data or query the model is acting on\n",
    "- **Output format**: Guide the structure (e.g., bullet points, JSON, short paragraph)\n",
    "\n",
    "Tips:\n",
    "- Be **explicit** and use **action verbs**: “List,” “Extract,” “Generate,” “Explain”\n",
    "- Run variations across sample inputs to identify the most effective phrasing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model-Specific Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prompts aren’t one-size-fits-all—**different models respond to different phrasing**.\n",
    "- Some models benefit from **examples or cues**, others may interpret instructions literally.\n",
    "- Use **temperature tuning**:\n",
    "  - Lower (e.g., 0.2): focused, deterministic output\n",
    "  - Higher (e.g., 0.8): creative, diverse output\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterate systematically:\n",
    "- Refine based on observed outputs\n",
    "- Adjust phrasing and model parameters\n",
    "- Be vigilant about **bias** and **hallucinated content**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use Structured Formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "Well-formatted prompts help the model distinguish intent from content. Try using:\n",
    "- Headings (`###`), markdown, or code blocks (` ''' `)\n",
    "- Delimiters: `{}`, `[]`, or custom tags (e.g., `<context>`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ask for structured output:\n",
    "- JSON, HTML, tables, or Markdown are all valid formats\n",
    "- Provide a correct example to guide the format  \n",
    "  > *“Return the result as a Python dictionary. Example: {'title': 'The Stars, Like Dust'}”*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Guide the Model’s Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "You can **prevent unwanted behaviors** by being explicit:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Discourage hallucination**:\n",
    "  > *“If the information is unknown, reply with: ‘I do not have that information.’”*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prevent assumptions or risky responses**:\n",
    "  > *“Do not speculate based on age, gender, or nationality.”*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Encourage deliberate reasoning** (Chain-of-Thought):\n",
    "  > *“Explain your reasoning step-by-step.”*\n",

    "  - Important instructions should be **repeated at the end**  \n",
    "    > *“Be a witty commentator throughout the movie. Don’t forget to stay funny.”*\n",

    "#### Prevent Misuse and Prompt Injection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt security** is often overlooked—here’s how to harden your prompts:\n",

    "### Section 4. Introduction to LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "**LangChain** is an open-source framework designed to simplify the development of applications that use large language models (LLMs). Instead of manually handling every step—from crafting prompts to managing model outputs—LangChain offers a structured way to chain together **components** like prompts, LLM calls, memory, tools, and output parsing.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, LangChain allows you to build **modular** and **reusable** workflows that are more maintainable, testable, and robust than writing raw code for each interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why use LangChain?\n",
    "\n",
    "Working directly with an LLM can be tedious:\n",
    "- You need to manually define prompts.\n",
    "- You must invoke model APIs directly.\n",
    "- You often have to parse and validate the output yourself.\n",
    "- For complex applications, you might need to manage memory or chain multiple model calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain abstracts and organizes these tasks while giving you **full control**:\n",
    "- **Prompt Templates**: Reusable, parameterized prompts.\n",
    "- **Chains**: Sequences of actions (e.g., prompt → model → parser).\n",
    "- **Memory**: Store conversation history across interactions.\n",
    "- **Tools and Agents**: Integrate external tools or dynamically choose actions based on model output.\n",
    "- **Output Parsers**: Standardize and validate model responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The framework makes experimentation faster and production applications more reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LangChain Workflow Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s walk through the key stages in a typical LangChain interaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Prompt Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of hardcoding static prompts, LangChain encourages using **PromptTemplates**. These are dynamic templates where you can inject variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "> Template: *\"Summarize the following text in one sentence: {text}\"*  \n",
    "> When called with `text = \"The stars shone brightly over the desert...\"`, it produces the full prompt dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "- Easy to maintain\n",
    "- Supports dynamic user input\n",
    "- Cleaner code structure\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Model Invocation (Functional API)\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain offers a **Functional API** to interact with models consistently:\n",
    "- `invoke()`: For single-shot interactions (one prompt → one output)\n",
    "- `stream()`: For streaming responses\n",
    "- `batch()`: For parallel requests\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of worrying about the underlying API differences between OpenAI, Hugging Face, Gemini, or Ollama models, you use the same method calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "> `response = model.invoke(prompt)`\n",
    "\n",
    "The model handles the heavy lifting (e.g., retries, error handling) transparently.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Output Parsing\n",
    "\n",
    "Many times, model outputs need post-processing:\n",
    "- You might want JSON, a list, or structured information.\n",
    "- Raw text outputs are often unpredictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain provides **Output Parsers** to help:\n",
    "- Simple regex parsers\n",
    "- Structured parsers for JSON or custom objects\n",
    "- Retry parsers (re-ask the model if the format is wrong)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "> Parse a model response into a Python dictionary  \n",
    "> Or verify that a list has exactly 3 items.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step makes outputs more usable and reduces bugs downstream.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Chaining Steps Together\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain’s real strength is building **chains**:\n",
    "- A chain can be a simple 2-step process (prompt → model → output)\n",
    "- Or a complex multi-step workflow (e.g., search documents → generate answer → validate output)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can build your own custom chains easily:\n",
    "- Sequential chains\n",
    "- Conditional chains (choose the next step based on model output)\n",
    "- Tool-based chains (use calculators, APIs, knowledge bases)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain **is not just another wrapper** around LLMs—it’s a structured way to build **repeatable, reliable** LLM-powered applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "It helps you:\n",
    "- **Separate concerns** (prompting, calling, parsing)\n",
    "- **Modularize logic**\n",
    "- **Reduce errors** through consistent parsing and retries\n",
    "- **Scale workflows** as your needs become more complex\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding how to use LangChain’s components effectively makes developing LLM applications **simpler**, **more predictable**, and **easier to maintain**."
