    "## What is Model Evaluation?\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with machine learning algorithms, data mining techniques, or statistical models, it is essential to assess whether a model has been trained effectively. Depending on the task, various metrics are available to measure the performance of a fitted model. Beyond raw metrics, there are key concepts for comparing models. Some techniques help identify overfitting, while others determine whether one model is simpler or more generalizable than another.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is Model Evaluation Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the optimal solution for a given problem, it is crucial to evaluate a model’s performance. Proper evaluation helps decide whether to continue training, adjust the preprocessing pipeline, or explore alternative models.\n",

    "Hierarchical clustering is a family of clustering algorithms that build nested clusters in a hierarchical structure. The result is typically represented as a **dendrogram**, a tree-like diagram where:\n",
    "- The **root** represents all data points in a single cluster.\n",
    "- The **leaves** represent individual data points.\n",
    "- **Branches** show how clusters are merged or split at different levels.\n",

    "1. **Agglomerative Clustering (Bottom-Up)**\n",

Instead, evaluation metrics focus on assessing whether the clusters effectively capture the structure of the data.\n",
