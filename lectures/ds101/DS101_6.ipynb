    "## What is Model Evaluation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with machine learning algorithms, data mining techniques or simple statistical models requires a proper indication if a model is trained properly. Depending on the task, there are several metrics available to estimate the goodness of a fitted model. Beside raw metrics there are some important concepts on how to compare models. Some of them shows if a model is overfitted, some can show if a model is simpler than the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is it important?\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the optimal solution for a given problem it is crucial to have an insight about the performance of the proposed models to decide whether to continue the training process, try a different preprocessing pipeline, or a different model.\n",

    "According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization):  \n",
    "_\"In the context of machine learning, __hyperparameter optimization__ or __model selection__ is the problem of choosing a set of hyperparameters for a learning algorithm, usually with the goal of optimizing a measure of the algorithm's performance on an independent data set. Often cross-validation is used to estimate this generalization performance.  \n",
    "Hyperparameter optimization contrasts with actual learning problems, which are also often cast as optimization problems, but optimize a loss function on the training set alone. In effect, learning algorithms learn parameters that model/reconstruct their inputs well, while hyperparameter optimization is to ensure the model does not overfit its data by tuning, e.g., regularization.\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is it important?\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the optimal solution to a given problem, one must train several models with similar predictive/exploratory power and select the simplest one. This process includes selecting models and finding optimal hyperparameters which is a time consuming and tedious work when done by hand. We use automatized solutions to overcome this problem, save time, and yield better results.\n",
