    "## Basic taxonomy of data science methods\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot of \"implicit\" information in the data which humans can't directly observe, but can be extracted by statistical methods (a.k.a. _analytics_). Our goal is exactly this. Basically, there are two main types of analytics:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Descriptive analytics\n",
    "<img src=\"https://udemy-images.udemy.com/course/750x422/90352_f733_7.jpg\" width=200 align=left> <br style=\"clear:left;\"/>\n",
    "**Goal:** To extract valuable information from a given dataset. Answer the question: _\"What has happened?\"_  \n",
    "**Example:** Describe the relation between the students' math grade in high school and their achieved points in the university statistics course's tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Predictive analytics\n",
    "<img src=\"http://blog.contentsquare.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/predictive-analysis-contentSquare-blog-5-620x350.png\" width=200 align=left> <br style=\"clear:left;\"/>\n",
    "**Goal:** Being able to make predictions on missing information based on previous knowledge. Answer the question: _\"What could happen?\"_   \n",
    "**Example #1:** When you apply for a loan, the bank gets your data, and puts it into its model for predicting the probability of you repaying that loan. Depending on this prediction it can choose to grant you the loan you asked for or not.  \n",
    "**Example #2:** A store has some information on its customers, and from that information it can determine what type of people visit its stores (like students, retirees, etc.). This way it can adjust the stores open hours to fit the need of the different group of customers it serves. (This is called clustering.)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "  \n",
    "There is another way of categorizing the statistical/machine learning/data mining methods: **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Supervised learning\n",
    "<img src=\"https://admin.imatrixbase.com/clients/13353/images/kittens_puppies.jpg\" width=200 align=left> <br style=\"clear:left;\"/>\n",
    "**Supervised learning** is based on data that is already 'labeled'. In other words we have data for which we know what the correct output is. We train our model on this dataset, and after this our model can predict the output of any input we give it (eg. is a picture shows a cat or a dog). The simplest supervised learning method is the linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unsupervised learning\n",
    "<img src=\"./pics/kacsa.png\" width=400 align=left> <br style=\"clear:left;\"/>\n",
    "With **unsupervised learning** we don't know what the correct output should be - we try to detect a hidden structure in the data. The simplest example for this is the above mentioned clustering example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we validate our model/output? In the case of unsupervised learning, we can't. With supervised learning, however the basic idea is pretty straightforward. We split our dataset into two parts: training and test set. We train our model _only on the training set_, and then compare the model's output on the test set to the known good output on it.\n",
