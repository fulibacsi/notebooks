    "\n",
    "There are two primary architectures for learning word embeddings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW)**: Predicts a target word based on surrounding context words in a given window. The model is order-invariant, meaning word order in the context does not affect predictions.\n",
    "- **Skip-Gram Model**: Predicts context words based on a given target word. Context words closer to the target word are weighted more heavily than those further away.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Neural Network Weights Become Embedding Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "The Word2Vec model is trained as a shallow neural network with one hidden layer. It learns to predict words based on their surrounding context (CBOW) or vice versa (Skip-Gram). The key insight is that after training, we **discard the output layer** and use the **weights of the hidden layer** as the word embeddings. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Representation**: Each word in the vocabulary is assigned a unique one-hot vector (a sparse vector where only one element is 1, and the rest are 0).\n",
    "2. **Projection Layer (Hidden Layer Weights)**: The one-hot input is multiplied by a weight matrix \\( W \\), mapping it into a dense vector space of lower dimensionality.\n",
    "3. **Output Layer (Discarded After Training)**: The model is trained to predict either a target word (CBOW) or context words (Skip-Gram) using another weight matrix \\( W' \\). However, once training is complete, we do not need this layer for embeddings.\n",
    "4. **Final Embedding Extraction**: The trained weights of the **first weight matrix \\( W \\) (input-to-hidden layer)** become the word embeddings. Each row in this matrix corresponds to a word's dense vector representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process allows similar words (based on their contexts) to have similar vector representations, capturing semantic relationships like **\"King - Man + Woman = Queen\"**.\n",
