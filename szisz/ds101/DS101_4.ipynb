    "## What is Dimensionality Reduction?\n",
    "Dimensionality reduction _\"is the process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration, and can be divided into feature selection and feature extraction.\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "_\"__Feature selection__ approaches try to find a subset of the original variables. ... In some cases, data analysis such as regression or classification can be done in the reduced space more accurately than in the original space.\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "_\"__Feature extraction__ transforms the data in the high-dimensional space to a space of fewer dimensions. The data transformation may be linear, as in principal component analysis (PCA), but many nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques also exist.\"_ from: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction\">Wiki</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is it important?\n",
    "With hundreds of features in the datasets, there will always be some which does not contribute to the overall precision of the predictive model. These features could be redundant, overlapping or linear combination of each other or simply irrelevant to the prediction. To improve training and transformation/prediction time, it is crucial to reduce the number of features to a moderate amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality\">The curse of dimensionality</a>\n",

    "\n",
    "This is our greatest enemy, after over/underfitting. With the increase of dimensions, the number of possible states or input vectors grow **exponentially**. Even in the most basic case of binary variables, in a moderate amount of say, 50 dimensions, we'll have $2^{50} > 10^{15}$ number of possible inputs. This means that for the same effectiveness, **we need exponentially more training points**!\n",

    "\n",
    "_\"The main linear technique for dimensionality reduction, principal component analysis, performs a linear mapping of the data to a lower-dimensional space in such a way that the variance of the data in the low-dimensional representation is maximized. In practice, the covariance (and sometimes the correlation) matrix of the data is constructed and the eigen vectors on this matrix are computed. The eigen vectors that correspond to the largest eigenvalues (the principal components) can now be used to reconstruct a large fraction of the variance of the original data. Moreover, the first few eigen vectors can often be interpreted in terms of the large-scale physical behavior of the system. The original space (with dimension of the number of points) has been reduced (with data loss, but hopefully retaining the most important variance) to the space spanned by a few eigenvectors.\"_ from: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction#Principal_component_analysis_.28PCA.29\">Wiki</a>\n"
