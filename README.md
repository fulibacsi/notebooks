# Notebooks 

Jupyter Notebooks for teaching, presentations and other simple purposes. Lecture notebooks are regularly improved.


## Lectures

### Python101

Introduction to python in an episodic structure, ideal for teaching beginner non-IT people. Each chapter consists multiple concepts with several examples and exercises.
The first 5 notebook is introduction to programming ending in object oriented paradigm. The remaining notebooks covers webscraping with minimal HTML introduction and data transformations with pandas.

### DS101

Introduction to Data Science in Python. Building on the Python101 material, this set of notebooks introduces the most important basic DS concepts with several examples and exercises. The lecture's main promise is that every chapter not only introduces you a a new concept and the relevant tools to work with your data but also gives you a model to play around with. The pipeline concept is introduced in the very beginning, and you build and extend your pipeline throughout the class.

### Webscraping and NLP tutorial

A really short introduction to webscraping and classic (tokenization, lemmatization, vectorization) and modern (word embeddings) NLP tools.  

### Python for beginners

Python 101 material splitted by topics.

### Python for IT

Python 101 reworked and advanced topics are changed from webscraping / pandas introduction to system libraries, regular expressions, parsing, and REST API topics.
